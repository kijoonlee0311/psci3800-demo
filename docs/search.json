I became intrigued how the NGO’s source of revenue affects the degree to which they partake in political activity. According to Mahmood and Gull (2016), NGO’s express that government funding, despite the financial stability it provides, has decreased their autonomy to pursue its missions. In addition, Bloodgood and Boire (2016) found that increase in government funding was negatively associated with NGO lobbying expenditures. In the end, exploring how powerful government funding is in influencing the political activity of the NGO is critical to determining if state funding for NGO’s is a net gain or loss for society. I will use the data collected from 86 Cambodian Civil Society Organizations (CSO) to examine this relationship."

    "section": "Hypothesis",
    "text": "Hypothesis\nDoes increased financial contribution from Cambodian government have a negative association with the political engagement of Cambodian CSO’s? I suspect this relationship because the more money the CSO gets from the government, the more difficult it is for it to engage in political activity that may jeopardize that money. According to Freedom House, open criticism of the prime minister or the government can result in reprisals, and the state power is often internally unchecked. The Cambodian government may retract its awards or contracts when a CSO expresses criticism of the state."
